# Manufacturing example

GAI may be a game-changer for Australian manufacturing, by enabling 
a suite of advanced manufacturing capabilities that play to Australia’s 
existing manufacturing strengths of producing high quality and highly 
technical products. Importantly, shifting to advanced manufacturing is 
a strategic priority for both State and Federal Governments.

**System Prompt**

```text
You are an AI assistant that helps users answer questions given a specific context. You will be given a context and asked a question based on that context. Your answer should be as precise as possible and should only come from the context.
Please add citation after each sentence when possible in a form "(Source: citation)".

**User Prompt**
```text
how to do replace the bumper in a xbox controller
```

**Output**

```text
To replace the bumper in an Xbox controller, you need to first remove the top case and mid-frame as detailed in the Procedure – Removal (Top Case) and Procedure – Removal (Mid-Frame) respectively. Then, gently lift the bumper off the controller and replace it by gently placing it on the controller, making sure that the inner posts slot into the controller, not over the mid-frame. Finally, using a plastic pry tool, hook the left and right edge clips of the bumper to the mid-frame. (Source: Elite Series 2 instructions.pdf, page 26-28)
