## Samples

| Id    | Industry       | Overview                                                         | Samples                                      |
|-------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1. | Healthcare     | With less time spent on admin, more time can be spent attending to a patient’s complex needs or seeing more patients. | **Hack** <br /> - [Healthcare Prompts](./prompts/healthcare/1-healthcare.md) <br /><br /> **POC** <br /> - [Python Notebook](./notebooks/python/healthcare/1-healthcare.ipynb) <br /> <br /> **MLP** <br /> *None yet.* |
| 2. | Financial Services | Use GAI to analyse your transactions to keep you safe & offer recommendations | **Hack** <br /> - [Finance Prompts](./prompts/financial-services/2-financial-services.md) <br /><br /> **POC** <br /> - [Part 1: Finance Dotnet Notebook](./notebooks/dotnet/finance/3-financial-services.ipynb) <br /> <br /> **MLP** <br /> - [Project Miyagi](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/miyagi) <br /> - [Part 2: Finance Python Notebook](./notebooks/python/finance/3-financial-services-using-autogen.ipynb)   |
| 3. | Retail & Customer Services | Use GAI to analyse compliance failures or generate product marketing content. | **Hack** <br /> - [Retail Prompts](./prompts/retail/1-retail.md) <br /><br /> **POC** <br /> - [Dotnet Notebook](./notebooks/dotnet/retail/4-retail.ipynb) <br /> <br /> **MLP** <br /> - [Plugin](./plugins/retail/1-retail.md) |
| 4. | Manufacturing | Use GAI to assist up-skilling of apprentices and technicians, through conversational on-the-job training of simple concepts. | **Hack** <br /> *None yet.* <br /><br /> **POC** <br /> - [ML Flow](./flows/manufacturing/1-manufacturing.md) <br /> <br /> **MLP** <br /> *None yet.* |

## Common use-cases for LLMs:
| Use Case                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Summarisation**                          | Large language models can condense lengthy texts into shorter summaries, retaining key information, which is helpful in digesting large volumes of information quickly. |
| **Writing Aid**                            | They can assist in drafting, editing, or enhancing written content by suggesting better word choices, correcting grammar, or even helping with style and tone.          |
| **Image Generation**                       | Though primarily designed for text, some models can be fine-tuned to generate images from textual descriptions, bridging the gap between language and visual representation. |
| **Code Generation or Transformation**      | By understanding programming languages, these models can aid in writing code, debugging, or even translating code between different programming languages.              |
| **Chat and Conversation**                  | Large models can simulate human-like conversations in chatbots, providing natural responses and maintaining contextual understanding over a dialogue.                     |
| **Question-answering**                    | They excel at providing precise answers to user queries by searching through large datasets or pre-trained knowledge, making them useful in customer service or education.   |
| **Reason over Structured or Unstructured Data** | They can analyse and draw insights from data, whether structured (like databases) or unstructured (like text documents), aiding in decision-making processes.              |
| **Search**                                 | By understanding the semantic meaning behind queries, large language models can enhance search engine capabilities, delivering more relevant results.                     |


### Extrapolate these into your own scenarios:

| Category  | Example                                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Analyse**    | Support customers to understand and reconcile costs and invoices across dimensions.                                                                 |
| **Insights**   | Actionable insights into cloud usage and costs using their own and similar customer's data.                                                        |
| **Optimise**   | Provide tools and recommendations for customers to optimise on their cloud costs.                                                                  |
| **Simulate**   | Enable customers to simulate scenarios which would change their future cloud costs.                                                                |
